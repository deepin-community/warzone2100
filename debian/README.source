If you want to rebuild the quickstartguide.pdf file from source, you need to
add

    wkhtmltopdf

to Build-Depends in debian/control. This works on all supported architectures
except mipsel where the program segfaults. In order to prevent a FTBFS and a
release critical bug this manual method is required as long as wkhtmltopdf is
buggy on mipsel.
